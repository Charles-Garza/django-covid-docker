# RowdyHacks 2020

Welcome to our RowdyHacks 2020 project!

This project is aimed towards showing the current covid-19 cases around the state of Texas. 

If we happen to have more time, we will aim to show the cases for the United States and 
hopefully integrate a map showing outbreaks.


**__Dependencies needed to run the project__**:
```
- Python3
- Django 3.0.4
```
